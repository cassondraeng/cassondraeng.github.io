                <h1>A Novel Interdisciplinary Approach</h1>
                <p>When I'm not conducting research, I'm a group fitness 
                instructor for <a href="https://www.lesmills.com/about-us/">Les Mills</a>, 
                a program offered in 100 countries around the world. What differentiates 
                this exercise program from others is that the routines are designed through 
                scientifically-based research through collaboration with kinesiologists and 
                exercise physiologists.</p>

                <p><br>
                Recent research has converged on an intriguing finding: exercise through 
                interaction with a virtual environment improves cognitive skills that are
                 particularly important for academic achievement and success.</p>

                <p>School time dedicated to recess has dwindled and few 
                children receive the recommended amount of physical activity. Technology 
                use is prevalent in almost every aspect of K-12 education, and 
                on average, children ages 2- to 4-years old play digital games for
                 21 minutes daily. As the use of digital games in young childhood 
                 vastly increases, effective interventions for fostering cognitive 
                 skills raise great interest. Exergames are a generation of widely 
                 availble video games that promote both cognitive and motor stimulation.
                  Exergames can easily be implemented in everyday lifestyles and have 
                  high potential to benefit cognitive skills that are crucial for 
                  academic success for students. Exergames are also ideal for use 
                  by children because they contain nonviolent content, may be especially
                   useful for children from low socioeconomic households who 
                   may not have access to safe recreational equipment, and for 
                   children with negative perceptions of exercising around others 
                   because exergames continuously adapt the difficulty level based 
                   on performance and match children’s individual capabilities.</p>

                <p>Cognitive function interventions are used as remediation or 
                prevention of cognitive deficits, so <b>early intervention is 
                crucial</b>; yet little research has conducted training interventions 
                involving exergames with children below school-age. Currently,
                 I am investigating whether exergame-induced training before entering 
                 formal schooling may enhance the functioning of cognitive skills,
                  and with carefully controlled experiments determine the 
                  underlying mechanisms of <i>why</i>.</p>

                <p> Historically, the disciplines of exercise physiology, developmental psychology and cognitive science, art and technology have had little interaction together despite being able to answer important questions when molded together. I'm bringing together these disciplines in my on-going research to contribute to the fields and make an impact on the community.</p>
