                <h1>A Novel Interdisciplinary Approach</h1>
                <p>When I'm not conducting research, I'm a group fitness instructor for <a href="https://www.lesmills.com/about-us/">Les Mills</a>, a program offered in 100 countries around the world. What differentiates this exercise program from others is that the routines are designed through scientifically-based research through collaboration with kinesiologists and exercise physiologists.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Recent research has converged on an intriguing finding: exercise through interaction with a virtual environment improves cognitive functions like inhibiotry control and attention regulation, skills that are particularly important for academic achievement and success.</p>

                <p>Yet, school time dedicated to recess has dwindled and few children receive the recommended amount of physical activity. Children with low physical activity self-efficacy and enjoyment or negative perceptions of exercising around others might be discouraged from fully engaging and participating in group exercise games or sports. Other children might not have access to safe recreational equipment. Exergames (concurrent motor and physical activity stimulation) are a new generation of video games that promote a more active, whole-body gaming experience. Exergames require similar skills sports and group exercise games do: anticipating the behavior of opponents, employing strategies, and adapting to ever-changing task demands to accomplish a challenging goal while coordinating the body to execute complex movements. Importantly, exergames can implement algorithms for continuously adapting the difficulty level to children’s individual performance so they are challenged at the right level. </p>

                <p>During the period of immaturity in prekindergarten children (i.e., 3- to 5-year-olds), progressive and regressive changes (e.g., myelination and synaptic pruning, respectively) occur concurrently and are driven in part by the child’s experiences. Cognitive function interventions are used as remediation or prevention of cognitive deficits, so <b>early intervention is crucial</b>; yet little research has conducted training interventions involving complex motor movements with children below school-age. Currently, I am investigating whether exergame-induced training before entering formal schooling may enhance the functioning of cognitive skills, and with carefully controlled experiments determine the underlying mechanisms of <i>why</i>.</p>
