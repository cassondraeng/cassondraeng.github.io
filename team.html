                    <p> What brings me joy? Mentoring students. My formal training in education (i.e., evidence-based practices of how students learn) and my own experience with outstanding mentors have taught me to tailor my mentoring style to meet the <b>individual needs</b> of each student, with a particular focus on student mental health and fostering a supportive group environment. Seeing students learn and thrive, getting them excited about science, and paying my experience forward to watch them grow personally and professionally is truly rewarding. My completed and ongoing projects would not be possible without the dedicated and creative team I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead.
