          <p>I was a Scholar in Virginia Tech’s Post-Baccalaureate Research and Education Program (PREP). <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/PREP">PREP</a> was created by 
          the National Institutes of Health to encourage students from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue research careers through competitive doctoral programs.</p>

         <br><p>Students from underrepresented groups often feel ostracized and disconnected from their peers. My interactions with my advisor Dr. Martha Ann Bell and her lab, my Director: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6307/1586">Dr. Ed Smith</a>, my PREP mentor, Shara Grant, and my cohort provided me with a space in which I could feel connected, and this heightened my self-efficacy within and outside a laboratory setting. Instead of giving me minimal work, I was challenged to think critically. </p>

          <p>I serve as a mentor in the Summer Program for Undergraduate Researchers (SPUR) at
           Carnegie Mellon by supervising summer research apprenticeships of visiting 
           undergraduate students. SPUR was created by PIER to encourage underrepresented, 
           first-generation college, and economically disadvantaged students to 
           pursue research careers through exposure to innovative research, 
           experimental and statistical methods, and professional development 
           skills that are essential to succeed in academia. The support I received from 
            prior mentors combated the negative feelings that arise from being 
            one of few minorities in an academic setting, and I strive to do the 
            same for others.  
          </p>
          <p>
              My faculty advisor Dr. Anna Fisher and I mentored Jonathan Epps, a Political Science major from Morehouse College. At the end of the summer research program, Jonathan presented the remarkable findings of his summer project to graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty members in several CMU departments. We couldn’t be more proud of him.

          <p>We were also lucky to have Aria Tsegai-Moore, a Psychology major from Stony Brook University as a visiting CMU scholar. She presented the findings from her summer project at one of the largest conferences for underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) in California. She was awarded the Top Presentation Award. </p>

            The Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemoration holds its annual MLK Day of Service every year in January on Martin Luther King Day. MLK Day is normally a day that students "take off from classes," but it is truly a “Day On” when we take time to give back to the community and surrounding areas. I am grateful for the experience of facilitating groups of students as an MLK Day of Service Team Leader, as we volunteered together and listened to voices at the <i>World in Conversation Day of Dialogue</i> and discussed current challenges and how to address them.
